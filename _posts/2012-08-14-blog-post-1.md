# Motivation
Brilliant another blog post on linear regression, how creative (*eye roll*). Why would I make this post (I hear no one ask)? Well having dablled in a few ML/Statistics projects, I have begun to realise how important it is to have a very **strong foundational understanding** of core concepts, before trying to undertake more complex ones. So I put my ego and my desire to dive into all the flashy ML models, and went to the first chapter of any book on statistical learning. Linear regression.  

I tasked myself with the challenge of building a linear regression model from scratch in Python (no scipy allowed!). This will be easy I thought. But as I started to read more (link further down page to further reading) into Linear Regression and began to build out the model, I realised how shallow my knowledge of Linear Regression actually was. 

In this post I will take you along my journey to "*re-learning*" linear regression from scratch. I hope to present it in a way that may be different to how you were taught it at university (or at least how I was), and detail my intial pitfalls when attempting to build out my own mock Scipy linregress function.
