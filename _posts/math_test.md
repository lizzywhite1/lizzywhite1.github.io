# Testing Math Delimiters

## Inline Math
This is inline math: $E = mc^2$ and another example: $\theta = \frac{a}{b}$

## Block Math
Here's a block math equation:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

And another block equation:

$$\begin{align}
y &= mx + b \\
&= 2x + 3
\end{align}$$

## Mixed Content
You can have text with $inline$ math and then block math:

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n$$

And more text with $another$ inline equation.
